TODO:
- Polish textboxes //
- Add camera names //
- Finish buttons //
- Finish rectangles /
- Optimize the order in which Point2DNews and Transformations are defererenced/referenced
- Add "GetScreenValue(const Camera* const)" to various classes in 'RectangleNew.h'
- Figure out how to optionally bind pos to reference centering?
- Handle inputs properly when clicked out of window (set all inputs to 0?)

- Make camera.rect private (because changing camera pos or size should also update camera.mouse_pos) (I don't think I'm doing this anymore)
- Make text_box text centering in relation to parent_rect offset more intuitive

- Add simple IDE
- Create server for online games
- Create online game explorer


Finish this by the year 2090


- When a link is followed and the link was previously visited but not finished, the current_visable_char_progression is set incorrectly (finished for some reason)
