TODO:
- Polish textboxes //
- Add camera names //
- Finish buttons //
- Finish rectangles (add rotation support, make flip of type SDL_RendererFlip, make single white pixel to accomplish this)

- Make camera.rect private (because changing camera pos or size should also update camera.mouse_pos) (I don't think I'm doing this anymore)
- Make text_box text centering in relation to parent_rect offset more intuitive

- Add simple IDE
- Create server for online games
- Create online game explorer


Finish this by the year 2090
